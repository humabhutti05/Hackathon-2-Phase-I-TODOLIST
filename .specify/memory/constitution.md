# Constitution of The Evolution of Todo

## Vision
To build a progressively complex software system starting from a simple CLI and evolving into a distributed, cloud-native AI system, demonstrating the power of agentic development.

## Core Principles
1. **Agentic-First Development**: All code is generated thru AI agents using a spec-driven workflow.
2. **Spec-Driven**: Every feature begins with a clear specification before implementation.
3. **Clean Code**: Adherence to Pythonic principles (PEP 8) and distributed systems best practices.
4. **Accountability**: Every iteration is documented in the specs history.

## Technology Guardrails
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Package Manager: UV
- Architecture: Evolution from In-Memory to Distributed.
